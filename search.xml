<h1 id="Education"><a href="#Education" class="headerlink" title="Education"></a>Education</h1><p>I did my undergraduate study in University of Science &amp; Technology Beijing (<strong>USTB</strong>) and Beijing Information &amp; Science Technology University(<strong>BISTU</strong>), majoring in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Intelligent Robotic Technology. I was lucky enough to be selected as one of the first group of students for “Experimental Class” (实验班), an elite title accompanied by heigh-level training in mathematics and robotic. I finished the 1.5 year of intensified basic science training  and chose to major in Robot Technology in the rest of my program. My thesis project was about mechanical structure design of rehabilitation Robot.</p>
<p>In 2018，I continued my study in professor Zhonglin WANG’s group in Beijing Institute of Nanoenergy and Nanosystems, Chinese Academy and Sciences, China as a master of science student. My research project is about Nanogenetor, Bio-inspired Intelligent Materials, MEMS and Flexible Electronics.  It is intensive, even exhausting sometimes. I work with the best minds in this field and have access to the best instruments I can imagine. So, nothing to complain.</p>
<p>In future, I want to apply for PhD  to do more valuable, interesting, challenging and interdisciplinary research about Wearable Electronics based on Nanogenerator to solve some medical problems in my PhD study.<strong>1-4</strong></p>

<h3 id="PAST-Robot（Mechanical-Engineering"><a href="#PAST-Robot（Mechanical-Engineering" class="headerlink" title="PAST- Robot（Mechanical Engineering)"></a>PAST- Robot（Mechanical Engineering)</h3><p>As I  was very fascinated by <strong>Robots</strong>, so I unhesitatingly joined Water Robot Team, a best student team in my university,  when I was an entering freshmen. With my team members, we started pursuing a project in the emerging interdisciplinary field of  Robot and Health Medical. We collaborated on intelligent wheelchair controlled by brain wave to help patients, who have severe movement disorders, communicate by using eye blink detected from brain waves and same can be used control the wheel chair. My thesis project was about mechanical structure design of rehabilitation robot to increase the ease of activities in the daily lives of patients.</p>

Meanwhile, I know more about other applications of nanogenerator  like in the field of heart, biomedical and solar energy, regularly communicating with my friends who are in other research group. Recently, I am engaging in a project about using nanogenetor to give the paralyzed new tactile sense.</p>

If possible , I also want to develop <strong>medical miniature robots</strong> that work in vivo and in vitro, which can be potentially deployed in minimally invasive diagnosis and therapeutics. Issues such as biocompatibility and biodegradability will be taken into consideration in the design of the medical robots. When deployed inside human bodies, the feedback information of the robots is limited and obscured, in which scenarios accurate and reliable actuation and control of these robots are challenging and will be investigated in my following research.</p>

    <title>The 1-hour workday</title>
    <url>/2018/12/21/The%201-hour%20workday/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<img src=" https://pic.downk.cc/item/5ece679ec2a9a83be5dcd43b.png" alt="1" width="600" />

<hr>
<p>When I was an assistant professor, I felt constantly overwhelmed. I had classes to teach, relationships with new colleagues to navigate, a lab group to assemble, and an infant at home—not to mention research to conduct and papers to publish. To get ahead, I took on any opportunities that were offered, including membership on various editorial boards and professional committees. Despite working like a madman, my productivity as measured by paper output was meager. I simply could not find time in my day for undistracted writing. And when I did find the time after an extended stretch away from writing, the warm-up period to get back into the paper was often long, further slowing my progress.</p>
<p><code>“I wake up early, make an espresso, and write until I&#39;m spent.”</code></p>
<a id="more"></a> 
<p>At first I thought that this kind of frustration was routine for academic researchers. But as the years passed, I noticed a few senior colleagues who published with impressive regularity and always had a paper in the works. When I asked them what their secret was, I found that they prioritized doing small amounts of focused writing every day. I’ve since developed my own version of this approach. I call it the 1-hour workday, referring to the short, sacrosanct period when I do what I see as the “real” work of academia: writing papers.<br><img src=" https://pic.downk.cc/item/5ece679ec2a9a83be5dcd439.jpg" alt="2" width="300" /><br>First thing in the morning is when I’m at my mental best, and when I’m still most in control of my time, so I now use the first hour of my day to write. For me, it’s best done from home. I’ve developed something of a ritual: I wake up early, make an espresso, and write until I’m spent—or until distractions like email or the day’s deadlines and meetings start to intrude. This is usually about an hour, some days a little less and some days more. I’ve found that, like hitting a ball in golf, regular writing is easier if I tee it up. I plan my early morning writing the night before. It is in my calendar and on my to-do list, with details about which paper and section I will be working on.<br><img src=" https://pic.downk.cc/item/5ece679ec2a9a83be5dcd437.png" alt="3" width="600" /><br>This routine has transformed my work life. Instead of the frustration that frequently plagued me early in my career, now—no matter how work proceeds after I’ve completed my writing time—I go home at the end of the day with the satisfaction of having accomplished something.<br>I have in no way mastered the writing game, but my 1-hour workday has certainly increased my academic output. And by keeping me focused and in practice, it has improved the quality of my writing and made the process much more enjoyable. It also offers an opportunity for deep thinking. I remember rarely having any such thinking time when I started out as a professor, but now I find that my daily keystrokes can lead to new ideas. When I string together days of successful writing, ideas flow and new connections present themselves even when I’m away from my keyboard, particularly on my bike ride to work or when I’m reading for pleasure.<br><img src=" https://pic.downk.cc/item/5ece679dc2a9a83be5dcd433.jpg" alt="4" width="300" /><br>Many days, “writing” means editing and revising the work of others. This work can sometimes be a slog, but I keep my spirits up by thinking of it as a game of table tennis. My goal is to return the serve—when done quickly, this greatly improves the game.<br><img src=" https://pic.downk.cc/item/5ece679dc2a9a83be5dcd42e.jpg" alt="5" width="300" /><br>In any sport, one must stay toned and conditioned. If I fall out of practice, I quickly lose that fitness, and my writing and editing become labored. So, even though distractions abound, I protect that daily workout at the keyboard during the first precious work hour of the day. I’ve learned that writing does not need long stretches of uninterrupted time. Focus and regularity are what matter. I now advise my Ph.D. students and postdocs who are going on to faculty positions to adopt daily writing as an early-career habit so that they don’t repeat my years of writing frustration. At any career stage, a daily writing ritual can help improve performance—and, perhaps most importantly, job satisfaction.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="A-Trip-Without-Plan"><a href="#A-Trip-Without-Plan" class="headerlink" title="A Trip Without Plan"></a>A Trip Without Plan</h1><hr>
<p>Today, as the life standard has improved, people have more money to chase amusement, travel is their first choice. So there are a lot of people on the journey during the public vacation, some people even quit their jobs to do it. The trip without plan was favored by many people since a few years ago, it was the attitude towards life.</p>
<p>Though people are proud of taking the independent travel, especially when they just go anytime and anywhere, only a few people take action. Some day, as I had the long summer vacation, I suddenly had the idea that I could take a trip without plan. So I asked two of my friends to joined my team. We booked the tickets and and hotel, then the next day, we took the train. We talked and appreciated the scenery outside the window. When we arrived the city, we just walked along the street and enjoyed the feature.</p>
<p>It was such great experience for me, sometimes we consider so many things and miss the joy of life. Taking a trip without burden and just go to any place you want once in your life.</p>

<h2 id="Golden-Lessons1-No-one-knows-everything-and-you-don’t-have-to"><a href="#Golden-Lessons1-No-one-knows-everything-and-you-don’t-have-to" class="headerlink" title="Golden Lessons1:No one knows everything, and you don’t have to."></a>Golden Lessons1:No one knows everything, and you don’t have to.</h2><p>When I received my undergraduate degree - about a hundred years ago - the physics literature seemed to me a vast, unexplored ocean, every part of which I had to chart before beginning any research of my own. How could I do anything without knowing everything that had already been done? Fortunately, in my first year of graduate school, I had the good luck to fall into the hands of senior physicists who insisted, over my anxious objections, that I must start doing research, and pick up what I needed to know as I went along. It was sink or swim. To my surprise, I found that this works. I managed to get a quick PhD - though when I got it I knew almost nothing about physics. But I did learn one big thing: that no one knows everything, and you don’t have to.</p>
<h2 id="Golden-Lessons2-Go-for-the-messes-that’s-where-the-action-is"><a href="#Golden-Lessons2-Go-for-the-messes-that’s-where-the-action-is" class="headerlink" title="Golden Lessons2: Go for the messes - that’s where the action is."></a>Golden Lessons2: Go for the messes - that’s where the action is.</h2><p>Another lesson to be learned, to continue using my oceanographic metaphor, is that while you are swimming and not sinking you should aim for rough water. When I was teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the late 1960s, a student told me that he wanted to go into general relativity rather than the area I was working on, elementary particle physics, because the principles of the former were well known, while the latter seemed like a mess to him. It struck me that he had just given a perfectly good reason for doing the opposite. Particle physics was an area where creative work could still be done. It really was a mess in the 1960s, but since that time the work of many theoretical and experimental physicists has been able to sort it out, and put everything (well, almost everything) together in a beautiful theory known as the standard model. My advice is to go for the messes - that’s where the action is.</p>
<h2 id="Golden-Lessons3-Forgive-yourself-for-wasting-time"><a href="#Golden-Lessons3-Forgive-yourself-for-wasting-time" class="headerlink" title="Golden Lessons3: Forgive yourself for wasting time."></a>Golden Lessons3: Forgive yourself for wasting time.</h2><p>My third piece of advice is probably the hardest to take. It is to forgive yourself for wasting time. Students are only asked to solve problems that their professors (unless unusually cruel) know to be solvable. In addition, it doesn’t matter if the problems are scientifically important - they have to be solved to pass the course. But in the real world, it’s very hard to know which problems are important, and you never know whether at a given moment in history a problem is solvable. At the beginning of the twentieth century, several leading physicists, including Lorentz and Abraham, were trying to work out a theory of the electron. This was partly in order to understand why all attempts to detect effects of Earth’s motion through the ether had failed. We now know that they were working on the wrong problem. At that time, no one could have developed a successful theory of the electron, because quantum mechanics had not yet been discovered. It took the genius of Albert Einstein in 1905 to realize that the right problem on which to work was the effect of motion on measurements of space and time. This led him to the special theory of relativity. As you will never be sure which are the right problems to work on, most of the time that you spend in the laboratory or at your desk will be wasted. If you want to be creative, then you will have to get used to spending most of your time not being creative, to being becalmed on the ocean of scientific knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="Golden-Lessons4-Learn-something-about-the-history-of-science-or-at-a-minimum-the-history-of-your-own-branch-of-science"><a href="#Golden-Lessons4-Learn-something-about-the-history-of-science-or-at-a-minimum-the-history-of-your-own-branch-of-science" class="headerlink" title="Golden Lessons4: Learn something about the history of science, or at a minimum the history of your own branch of science."></a>Golden Lessons4: Learn something about the history of science, or at a minimum the history of your own branch of science.</h2><p>Finally, learn something about the history of science, or at a minimum the history of your own branch of science.The least important reason for this is that the history may actually be of some use to you in your own scientific work. For instance, now and then scientists are hampered by believing one of the over-simplified models of science that have been proposed by philosophers from Francis Bacon to Thomas Kuhn and Karl Popper. The best antidote to the philosophy of science is a knowledge of the history of science.</p>
<p>More importantly, the history of science can make your work seem more worthwhile to you.As a scientist, you’re probably not going to get rich. Your friends and relatives probably won’t understand what you’re doing. And if you work in a field like elementary particle physics, you won’t even have the satisfaction of doing something that is immediately useful. But you can get great satisfaction by recognizing that your work in science is a part of history.</p>
<p>Look back 100 years, to 1903. How important is it now who was Prime Minister of Great Britain in 1903, or President of the United States? What stands out as really important is that at McGill University, Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy were working out the nature of radioactivity. This work (of course!) had practical applications, but much more important were its cultural implications. The understanding of radioactivity allowed physicists to explain how the Sun and Earth’s cores could still be hot after millions of years. In this way, it removed the last scientific objection to what many geologists and paleontologists thought was the great age of the Earth and the Sun. After this, Christians and Jews either had to give up belief in the literal truth of the Bible or resign themselves to intellectual irrelevance. This was just one step in a sequence of steps from Galileo through Newton and Darwin to the present that, time after time, has weakened the hold of religious dogmatism. Reading any newspaper nowadays is enough to show you that this work is not yet complete. But it is civilizing work, of which scientists are able to feel proud.</p>

<h1 id="Our-Dream"><a href="#Our-Dream" class="headerlink" title="Our Dream"></a>Our Dream</h1><p>We proposed that the ultimate goal of the RoboCup Initiative to be stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the middle of the 21st century, a team of fully autonomous humanoid robot soccer players shall win a soccer game, complying with the official rules of FIFA, against the winner of the most recent World Cup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We propose that this goal will be one of the grand challenges shared by the robotics and AI communities for the next 50 years. This goal may sound overly ambitious given the state of the art of technology today. Nevertheless, we believe it is important that such a long-range goal should be set and pursued. It took only 50 years from the Wright Brothers’ first aircraft to the Apollo mission, to send a man to the moon and safely return him to the earth. It also took only 50 years, from the invention of the digital computer to Deep Blue, which beat the human world champion in chess. Building a humanoid soccer player requires an equally long period and extensive efforts of a broad range of researchers, and the goal will not be met in the near future.<br><img src=" https://pic.downk.cc/item/5e7a29ee9dbe9d88c51dcac2.jpg" alt="avatar" width="600" /></p>

<h1 id="A-Brief-History-of-RoboCup"><a href="#A-Brief-History-of-RoboCup" class="headerlink" title="A Brief History of RoboCup"></a>A Brief History of RoboCup</h1><p>In the history of artificial intelligence and robotics, the year 1997 will be remembered as a turning point. In May 1997, IBM Deep Blue defeated the human world champion in chess. Forty years of challenge in the AI community came to a successful conclusion. On July 4, 1997, NASA’s MARS Pathfinder mission made a successful landing and the first autonomous robotics system, Sojourner, was deployed on the surface of Mars. Together with these accomplishments, RoboCup made its first steps toward the development of robotic soccer players which can beat a human World Cup champion team.</p>
<p>The idea of robots playing soccer was first mentioned by Professor Alan Mackworth (University of British Columbia, Canada) in a paper entitled “On Seeing Robots” presented at VI-92, 1992. and later published in a book Computer Vision: System, Theory, and Applications, pages 1-13, World Scientific Press, Singapore, 1993. A series of papers on the Dynamo robot soccer project was published by his group.</p>
<p>Independently, a group of Japanese researchers organized a Workshop on Grand Challenges in Artificial Intelligence in October, 1992 in Tokyo, discussing possible grand challenge problems. This workshop led to a serious discussions of using the game of soccer for promoting science and technology. A series of investigation were carried out, including a technology feasibility study, a social impact assessment, and a financial feasibility study. In addition, rules were drafted, as well as prototype development of soccer robots and simulator systems. As a result of these studies, the researchers concluded that the project was feasible and desirable. In June 1993, a group of researchers, including Minoru Asada, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and Hiroaki Kitano, decided to launch a robot competition, tentatively named the Robot J-League (J-League is the name of the newly established Japanese Professional soccer league). Within a month, however, they received overwhelming reactions from researchers outside of Japan, requesting that the initiative be extended as an international joint project. Accordingly, they renamed the project as the Robot World Cup Initiative, “RoboCup” for short.</p>
<p>Concurrent to this discussion, several researchers were already using the game of soccer as a domain for their research. For example, Itsuki Noda, at ElectroTechnical Laboratory (ETL), a government research center in Japan, was conducting multi-agent research using soccer, and started the development of a dedicated simulator for soccer games. This simulator later became the official soccer server of RoboCup. Independently, Professor Minoru Asada’s Lab at Osaka University, and Professor Manuela Veloso and her student Peter Stone at Carnegie Mellon University had been working on soccer playing robots. Without the participation of these early pioneers of the field, RoboCup could not have taken off.</p>
<p>In September 1993, the first public announcement of the initiative was made, and specific regulations were drafted. Accordingly, discussions on organizations and technical issues were held at numerous conferences and workshops, including AAAI-94, JSAI Symposium, and at various robotics society meetings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Noda’s team at ETL announced the Soccer Server version 0 (LISP version), the first open system simulator for the soccer domain enabling multi-agent systems research, followed by version 1.0 of Soccer Server (C++ Version) which was distributed via the web. The first public demonstration of this simulator was made at IJCAI-95.</p>
<p>During the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-95) held at Montreal, Canada, August, 1995, the announcement was made to organize the First Robot World Cup Soccer Games and Conferences in conjunction with IJCAI-97 Nagoya. At the same time, the decision was made to organize Pre-RoboCup-96, in order to identify potential problems associated with organizing RoboCup on a large scale. The decision was made to provide two years of preparation and development time, so that initial group of researchers could start robot and simulation team development, as well as giving lead time for their funding schedules.</p>
<p>Pre-RoboCup-96 was held during International Conference on Intelligence Robotics and Systems (IROS-96), Osaka, from November 4 – 8, 1996, with eight teams competing in a simulation league and demonstration of real robot for middle size league. While limited in scale, this competition was the first competition using soccer games for promotion of research and education.</p>
<p>The first official RoboCup games and conference was held in 1997 with great success. Over 40 teams participated (real and simulation combined), and over 5,000 spectators attended.</p>
